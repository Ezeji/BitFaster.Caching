# âš¡ Lightweight.Caching

A collection of lightweight caching primitives suitable for use on the hot path. Intended as an alternative to the System.Runtime.Caching.MemoryCache family of classes (e.g. HttpRuntime.Cache, System.Web.Caching et. al.), which cause heap allocations when the native object key is not type string.

## Meta-programming using structs for JIT dead code removal and inlining

ConcurrentLru features injectable policies defined as structs. Since structs are subject to special optimizations by the JITter, the implementation is much faster than if these policies were defined as classes. Using this technique, lookups without TTL are within 15% of the speed of a ConcurrentDictionary.

Since DateTime.UtcNow is around 4x slower than a ConcurrentDictionary lookup, policies that involve time based expiry are significantly slower. Since these are injected as structs and the slow code is optimized away, it is possible maintain the fastest possible speed for the non-TTL policy.
